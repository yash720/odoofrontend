   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy from frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   vercel
   ```

3. **Or deploy the dist folder:**
   ```bash
   vercel dist
   ```

### Option 2: Netlify

1. **Install Netlify CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

### Option 3: GitHub Pages

1. **Push dist folder to gh-pages branch:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   git add dist
   git commit -m "Deploy frontend"
   git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
   ```

### Option 4: Manual Upload

1. **Upload the `dist` folder contents to any static hosting service:**
   - AWS S3
   - Firebase Hosting
   - Surge.sh
   - Any web server

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

The frontend is configured to connect to your backend:

- **Backend URL**: `https://odoobackend-fdgh.onrender.com`
- **API Endpoint**: `https://odoobackend-fdgh.onrender.com/api`

## 🧪 Testing the Connection

### 1. Backend Health Check
Visit: `https://odoobackend-fdgh.onrender.com/health`

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "ReWear API is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-12T11:33:04.612Z",
  "environment": "development"
}
```

### 2. Frontend Features to Test

1. **User Registration/Login**
   - Try creating a new account
   - Test login with existing credentials
   - Verify JWT token storage

2. **Item Management**
   - Upload images (test Cloudinary integration)
   - Create new items
   - Browse items
   - View item details

3. **Admin Features**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Backend is configured to accept requests from `http://localhost:5173`
   - Update `CORS_ORIGIN` in backend if needed

2. **API Connection Errors**
   - Check browser console for network errors
   - Verify backend URL is correct
   - Test backend health endpoint

3. **Image Upload Issues**
   - Verify Cloudinary credentials in backend
   - Check file size limits
   - Ensure proper file types

### Debug Mode:

Enable debug logging in browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```
